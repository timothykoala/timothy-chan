abstract: |
  Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling is a highly pleiotropic pathway with an important role in development, homeostasis and cancer. Chromatin regulators contribute to the regulation of TGF-β responsive transcription. Requirement of subunits of the MLL3/MLL4 histone methyltransferase complexes for TGF-β responses have been reported. However, their exact roles are not fully understood.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
