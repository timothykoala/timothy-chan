Thanks for the multiomics data intergration and visualization workshop hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) at Wellcome Genome Campus in Hinxton, UK.

Althogh we are unable to travel on-site, the online version still worked. Times for single cells analysis and multiomics data intergration without constained by space and time zones.
